# Orlando Bravo Sanchez - Academic & Technical Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my personal projects repository! 👋  
This repository contains a collection of my academic and personal projects developed during my studies in **Computer Information Systems (CIS)**. The goal of this repository is to showcase my technical skills, learning progress, and practical experience in software development, programming, and web technologies.

# About Me

I am a Computer Information Systems student with a strong interest in:
- Software development
- IT support and systems
- Programming in Java and C++
- Web development (HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript)
- Problem solving and logical thinking

Through my coursework and practice, I have worked on multiple projects that demonstrate:

- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Basic data structures
- File handling and console applications
- Simple user interfaces and web forms
- Code organization and documentation

This repository serves as my **technical portfolio** and will continue to grow as I complete more projects and improve my skills.
